I am still working on this task.
Observations I have made till now
1.urandom(1) generates a random character.
2.function executes until key length is 5.
3.key should only contain alphabets. No special or integers
4.The value of key is set recursively
5.The function get_key() is called after a random key of length 5 is generated.
6.The hex key is generated after that
7.This hex is split into chunks of size 2 and key_list is generated.
8.ciphertext is generated by taking the ascii values of the characters.
9.To reverse the program hex must be coverted back to plaintext.
10.get_key() all possiblities of keys will be generated which is too many possiblities
