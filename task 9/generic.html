<p><h2>Task 2:</h2><br>
<strong>Hackerrank and codeforces</strong><br>
          These problems have been of moderate level....I have solved hackerrank 1,2,3,4,5 and codeforces 2,3,4,5....but couldn't solve codeforces 1...
  I am not able to get the logic behind the problem</p>
<b>Hackerrank 1:</b><br>
<p>This task was just involving the concept of a loop and comparing elements of an array by using the if else condition. I created a array called k having two element 0,0 where these are the initial points of Alice and Bob. Every time the first element of the first array becomes greate the point array's first element is incremented by one and vice versa. I have used python3 to solve the task.</p>

<b>Hackerrank 2:</b><br>
<p>This problem was involving the use of 2 dimensional array. I used 2 loops to access the array. I also initialised 2 sum1 and sum2 as 0. I didn't face any problem thinking of the first diagonal ie. involving the statement of the case when rows are equal to columns. I added sum1 to the array value each time the if-loop was satisfied.<br>
  The second case was a bit tricky as I had to search google for the condition of the second diagonal. I found the algorithm and then added sum2 to the elements each time the if-loop satisfied. Then I used the abs() function to get the desired result.</p>

<b>Hackerrank 3:</b><br>
<p>This problem I felt quite comfortable working with as it just involved a loop and a '+' symbol to concat 2 things ie the number of spaces ' ' and a symbol '#'. The number of spaces were determined by multiplying the loop where the integer x was increasing through the loop and was subtracted from the size of the of the staircase. And the number '#' and multiplying that by the increasing integer x in the loop.</p>

<b>Hackerrank 4:</b><br>
<p>This problem was a bit tricky. I spent at least 6 hours trying to figure out what to do. but the I realised that this just had one line code :/ . I just used the max() the inputted array. Then I used count() of max of the array. Then I simply returned it :7</p>
<a href="https://github.com/iammarco11/a-m-f-o-s-s---t-a-s-k-s-/blob/master/task2/hackerrank%204">Hackerrank-4</a><br>
<b>Hackerrank 5:</b><br>
<p>This was the most trickiest problem. I spent 2-3 days fully devoting to the problem. I googled and found out about a function called split(). It splits a string to a list by just stating where to split in the brackets. So after the string is splited into element of a list I used certain if conditions to convert AM and PM to a 24 hour clock and the AM and PM were replaced to spaces by using replace(). Now that I have the modified list I just concatenated the new elements. Then I put the print command. It still doesn't work for some custom inputs though I can not find what's wrong in my code :/</p>

<b>Codeforces 1:</b><br>
This is one tough problem I couldn't solve. I even drew all the possible drawings to find an algorithm. But I couldn't find one. I think it has got something to do with hcf of 3 sides.</p>

<b>Codeforces 2:</b><br>
<p>This problem was relatively very easy for me. All I had to do was get a input from the user which would be my size for the for loop for entering the strings. After that I put the if condition that if the string is less than or eaqual to 10 just print the inputted string, else its gonna print the first letter and the number of words between the first and last and the last letter which I concatenated.</p>

<b>Codeforces 3:</b><br>
<p>This task took a bit of time for me to think of and algorithm. The main challenge I faced was how to make the scores and the n and k into a list. Then I remembered of split(). I used it to make the inputted values into a list. I assigned count =0. After that I was able to access them after assigning each of them a variable. Succesfully put a for loop to input the scores n times. Then i used a if condition where each score is checked whether its greater than the the required score. If it is greater it will increment the count. Then I just printed the count out.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/iammarco11/a-m-f-o-s-s---t-a-s-k-s-/blob/master/task2/Codeforces%20158A">codeforces-3</a><br>
<b>Codeforces 4:</b><br>
<p>This was the easiest task in codeforces. I created a integer variable to be inputted. Then I assigned c=0. And after that I made a for loop to increment till the integer the user had inputted, to give the user a chance to input the variable being incremented or decremented. Then I used a if condition and an 'in' operator to increase the c by one if it is ++ and decrease it by 1 if it is --.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/iammarco11/a-m-f-o-s-s---t-a-s-k-s-/blob/master/task2/Codeforces%20282A">codeforces-4</a><br>
<b>Codeforces 5:</b><br>
<p>This problem looked tricky to me at first sight. But it was actually easy. There are 3 possibilities for this problem ie either 7 0's are together or 7 1's are together on nothing. So after the user inputs the string of integers I put a condition if 7 1's or 7 0's come together print yes else print no. I used the in operator for that job.</p>

<strong>Total Time taken</strong><br>
<p>Took about 8 days to completely finish it</p>
<dt><h2>Task 3 -Web scraping </h2></dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><h3><strong>Task Description</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a web scraper program designed with ruby. The program scrapes google search and returns the top 10 search results for the keyword "linux". The ruby program uses Nokogiri and open-uri gem.

Nokogiri (é‹¸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser. Among Nokogiri's many features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

OpenURI is an easy-to-use wrapper for Net::HTTP, Net::HTTPS and Net::FTP..</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>How the task was completed</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>I am still working on this. I installed nokogiri gem bundles and put the link to mske it html doc using nokogiri in command prompt.</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>Problems I faced</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>I am finding problems in producing a meaningful output after passing nokogiri to the link. Like what to do after that I dont know.</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>Estimated Time Taken</strong></h3></dt>

<dt><h2>Task 8 -Captcha Breaking </h2></dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><h3><strong>Task Description</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this task we had to write a python script which can interpret an image(.png/.jpg) having a mathematical expression (in this case I have taken an addition case), evaluate it and return the calculated value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>How the task was completed</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>Installed Tessarect OCR for the character expression then installed pytesseract for extracting text from the png file named 'image'. Now that string can be accessed by the elements. So after that I just added those elements and printed the value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>Links</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>This link <a href="https://github.com/iammarco11/a-m-f-o-s-s---t-a-s-k-s-/tree/master/task%208">Task8</a> contains the png file "image" that is the simple arithematic expression and captcha_breaking.py which is the python code for the task.</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>Problems I faced</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>I didnt know how to convert an image to a string. Then I googled and found out that tesseract was required. Then I installed Tesseract OCR and Pytesseract and saw a youtube video on the code to convert image to a string. I also found that on pypi pytesseract site.</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>Estimated Time Taken</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>3 days</p>
</dd>

</dl>
<dt><h2>Task 9-Create your own webpage</h2></dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt><h3><strong>Task Description</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>HTML5 was required to create a page. Then a jekyll theme had to be chosen for personalising the blog</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>How the task was completed</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
  <p>I selected a theme called spectral. I edited in HTML and then my webpage was made.</p> 
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>Problems I faced</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>I was totally new to HTML and had no background in it whatsoever. So I watched a crash course on HTML. Just to have a basic idea. After I completed making the webpage I had problems in changing the link to myusername.github.io. I searcged google but still couldnt find anything. What I did after that was make my own repository and copy all the files to it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><h3><strong>Estimated Time Taken</strong></h3></dt>
<dd>
<p>Took about 2 days to completely finish including changing the username.</p>
</dd>

<h2>Additional tasks</h2>
<h4><strong>Project Euler</strong></h4>
<p><b>Task 1:</b><br>
  I found the algorithm to the task but can't find the output as desired. But when I manually calculate I get the answer.<a href="https://github.com/iammarco11/a-m-f-o-s-s---t-a-s-k-s-/blob/master/additional%20tasks/project%20euler/task%201">task1</a>
<header><h1><b>My Experience doing all these tasks</b><h1>
  <p>When I started doing FOSS tasks I was like how do they accept us doing this level of problems with no sort of material to study on. I was quite slow when I started. I had no idea when to start, where to start, how to start. But I never gave up trying. I searched google and learnt basics of python by watching a 6 hour lecture on youtube. Now that I had a base, I started with task 2. These tasks were very interesting to me and kept me going on and on. All the tasks were awesome nut the one task which intrests me the most is creating a webpage of your own. I never ever imagined in my life I would get an opportunity to do this. I thank FOSS@amrita for giving me an opportunity to find out what truly interests me ie Web developing and problem solving.</p>
  <h1>My self evaluation</h2>
  <p>I will be honest with you....I was a 11th std computer fail :( I never got a grade above B in my life for computer. Back then I used to let go of things which I didnt understand and it became a huge problem later on during my 12 th std. But I was still interested in coding. That interest or that fire inside me is the reason that I am no longer weak as I was during my school days. After joining Amritapuri I think I worked pretty hard doing all this tasks. I have even sat upto 2 AM trying to figure out the algorithms. And these all are being done by me cause I do what I love. And I love programming and coding (most importantly problem solving). I think I have done a decent job in the tasks but yeah I could have done better if I had no college assignments :3 Not making any excuses though. Now I have learnt basics of HTML,Python 3,Ruby,Arduino and somewhat the whole of 11th and 12th std of c++. I am proud of myself as where I was before and where I am now. All thanks to FOSS and their tasks which kept me going and going and going till the very end without giving up.</p>
  <h1>If I get into FOSS...</h1>
  <p>If I get into FOSS I would devote all my free time to the club. I will never stop learning as these are the topics that interest me the most. I want to develop a social media site just for amrita students as it would help the students to get connected with each other. So this is my plan if I get into FOSS.</p>
  <h1>My comments and suggestions on the whole process...<h2>
    <p>To be honest, this procedure of selection is much much better and please don't change anything about it in the future. I think it motivates interested people to do more and more. Only 1 change I would recommend is that giving at least a month more to complete all the tasks.</p>
    <h1>Tasks I have skipped or couldn't complete</h1>
    <p><strong>Task 3 and Task 7:</strong><br>
      I am able to parse the results to nokogiri after that I am not able to do the next step. I have mentioned about it above. Task 7 I am having trouble installing docs of rust. It is showing some error on the command prompt. Even though I got a bit of the code as I learnt a bit about rust language through youtube, I am not able to chcek whether its correct or wrong.</p>
    <p><strong>Task 4, Task 5, Task 6 and Task 10</strong>
      I would have done these tasks if I am given a month more. I was having a lot of college assignments and still haven't completed them. But if I am given a bit more time I would love to do it.</p>
  <h1>For the next 6 months my plan<h1>
    <p> I have got a clear head on what to do for the next 6 months. I wanna go deep into HTML to learn web developing. I wanna solve more problems to strengthen my algorithm making. I also want to create a social media platform for all amritapuri students so that they can remain in touch or can post their pictures and see other people's posts.</p>
